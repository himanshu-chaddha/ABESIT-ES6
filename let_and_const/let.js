    now declaring a variable using let */

/* we could change any type of value to a let variable and it won't 
    throw any error because it works like var keyword */

/* we can't declare two variable with same name using let 
    it will throw an error, you can check this by uncommenting the line below */

// let name = "alpha";

/* also we can declare a variable using let with initializing it
    and can later define any value for that variable */

/* using let we can declare any number of variables in a single line */

let x, y, z;

/* to define different value to all different variable we can do like below*/
